        <p class="banner-text" >A sci-fi action adventure and the definitive origin story of Buzz Lightyear, the hero who inspired the toy,
            “Lightyear” follows the legendary Space Ranger after he’s marooned on a hostile planet 4.2 million
            light-years from Earth alongside his commander and their crew. As Buzz tries to find a way back home through
            space and time, he’s joined by a group of ambitious recruits and his charming robot companion cat, Sox.
            Complicating matters and threatening the mission is the arrival of Zurg, an imposing presence with an army
            of ruthless robots and a mysterious agenda.</p>

            <h2 class="tittle-text-film" >The Human Side of Buzz</h2>
            <p>“Buzz Lightyear has always been a determined, confident and heroic character, but with ‘Lightyear’ we get a chance to see a more vulnerable and human side of Buzz,” says Chris Evans, who lends his voice to the Space Ranger. “We witness his struggles, uncertainties and occasional failures.”</p>
            <p>Director Angus MacLane wanted the new side of the character to shine. “Buzz is such an iconic character. I wanted this film to be separate from ‘Toy Story.’ I thought of it more as a prequel. And I wanted it to be cinematic. I thought of Buzz as a different character—in a cool, low-key, clever way. </p>
            <p>The design of the character for “Lightyear” also needed to evolve to fit the director’s vision. “We wanted to give Buzz vulnerability,” says Matt Nolte, character art director. “We needed to take him to a place where we could empathize with him. His hairstyle, his shading, how they light him—it all came together to create Buzz Lightyear in a truly human way.”  </p>

            <h2 class="tittle-text-film" >Buzz Lightyear</h2>
            <p>Buzz Lightyear is a confident, loyal and accomplished Space Ranger whose pride in his work shines bright. “He enjoys the thrill and adventure of gallivanting around the galaxy, successfully completing missions with his friend and mentor, Commander Alisha Hawthorne,” says director Angus MacLane. “Buzz really enjoys the kind of comfort and familiarity that comes with being part of a tight-knit team.”</p>
